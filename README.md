# KachiDhamTrafficSim
Software-Based Traffic Congestion Reduction for Kachi Dham is a full-stack system built with React and Flask. It optimizes traffic flow using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and predicts congestion with machine learning. The solution offers real-time visualizations, enhancing urban mobility in high-density areas without the need for physical infrastructure.
